    <h1>Java interview questions</h1>

    <my-quiz>
        <my-pair>
            <my-question>What is the difference between abstract classes and interfaces in Java?</my-question>
            <my-answer>Abstract classes can have implemented methods and instance variables, while interfaces (before
                Java 8) could only have abstract method declarations. Since Java 8, interfaces can have default and
                static methods. A class can implement multiple interfaces but can only extend one abstract
                class.</my-answer>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>Explain the difference between == and .equals() in Java.</my-question>
            <my-answer>== compares object references (memory addresses), while .equals() compares the actual content of
                objects. For strings, .equals() checks character sequence, whereas == checks if they point to the same
                memory location. In the example, str1 == str2 would be false, but str1.equals(str2) would be
                true.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>What is the purpose of the 'final' keyword in Java?</my-question>
            <my-answer>When applied to variables, 'final' makes them constants that cannot be reassigned. For methods,
                it prevents method overriding. For classes, it prevents inheritance. Final variables must be initialized
                either at declaration or in the constructor.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>What is method overloading in Java?</my-question>
            <my-answer>Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists in
                the same class. The compiler determines which method to call based on the argument types and number. It
                provides flexibility in method usage while maintaining readability.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>Explain the concept of autoboxing and unboxing in Java.</my-question>
            <my-answer>Autoboxing is the automatic conversion of primitive types to their corresponding wrapper classes.
                Unboxing is the reverse process. This feature was introduced in Java 5 to simplify coding when working
                with collections and generics that require object types.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>What are the access modifiers in Java?</my-question>
            <my-answer>Java has four access modifiers:
                <ul>
                    <li>public: accessible from anywhere</li>
                    <li>private: accessible only within the same class</li>
                    <li>protected: accessible within the same package and subclasses</li>
                    <li>default (no modifier): accessible within the same package</li>
                </ul>
            </my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?</my-question>
            <my-answer>ArrayList uses a dynamic array for storage, providing fast random access but slower
                insertions/deletions. LinkedList uses a doubly-linked list, offering faster insertions/deletions but
                slower random access. Choose based on your specific use case and performance requirements.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>Explain the purpose of the 'throws' keyword.</my-question>
            <my-answer>The 'throws' keyword declares that a method might throw a specific exception, requiring calling
                methods to handle or further declare the exception. It's part of Java's checked exception mechanism,
                forcing developers to handle potential error scenarios.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>What is the purpose of the 'synchronized' keyword?</my-question>
            <my-answer>The 'synchronized' keyword ensures that only one thread can execute the method or block at a
                time, preventing race conditions and providing thread safety. It creates a lock on the object, allowing
                safe concurrent access to shared resources.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>Describe the try-with-resources statement.</my-question>
            <my-answer>Introduced in Java 7, try-with-resources automatically closes resources that implement
                AutoCloseable after the try block. It simplifies resource management, reduces boilerplate code, and
                ensures proper resource cleanup, even if an exception occurs.</my-answer>
