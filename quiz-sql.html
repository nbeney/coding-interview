    <h1>SQL interview questions</h1>

    <my-quiz>
        <my-pair>
            <my-question>What is the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN?
                <pre>
    -- INNER JOIN
    SELECT * FROM table1 
    INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;
    
    -- LEFT JOIN
    SELECT * FROM table1 
    LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;</pre>
            </my-question>
            <my-answer>INNER JOIN returns only matching rows from both tables. LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left
                table and matching rows from the right table. If no match exists, right table columns will contain NULL.
                LEFT JOIN preserves all records from the primary table, while INNER JOIN only returns intersecting
                records.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>Explain the difference between GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.
                <pre>
    SELECT department, AVG(salary) 
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department
    HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;</pre>
            </my-question>
            <my-answer>GROUP BY is used to group rows with similar values, typically with aggregate functions. HAVING
                filters groups after aggregation, while WHERE filters rows before aggregation. WHERE works on individual
                rows, HAVING works on grouped results. In the example, it calculates average salary per department and
                filters departments with average salary over 50000.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>What are ACID properties in database transactions?
                <pre>
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 
    WHERE account_id = 1;
    COMMIT;</pre>
            </my-question>
            <my-answer>ACID stands for Atomicity (all-or-nothing), Consistency (data remains valid), Isolation
                (concurrent transactions don't interfere), and Durability (committed changes persist). Ensures database
                transactions are processed reliably, maintaining data integrity even in case of errors, system failures,
                or concurrent access.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>Explain the difference between Primary and Foreign Keys.
                <pre>
    CREATE TABLE orders (
        order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        customer_id INT,
        FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id)
    );</pre>
            </my-question>
            <my-answer>Primary Key uniquely identifies each record in a table and cannot contain NULL values. Foreign
                Key creates a link between two tables, referencing the Primary Key of another table. In the example,
                order_id is a Primary Key, while customer_id is a Foreign Key linking to customers table.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>What are indexes and why are they used?
                <pre>
    CREATE INDEX idx_lastname 
    ON employees (last_name);</pre>
            </my-question>
            <my-answer>Indexes improve query performance by creating a data structure that allows faster data retrieval.
                They work like a book's index, enabling quick lookup without scanning entire tables. However, they
                consume additional storage and can slow down insert/update operations. Best used on columns frequently
                used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>Explain window functions.
                <pre>
    SELECT 
        employee_name, 
        department, 
        salary,
        AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) as dept_avg
    FROM employees;</pre>
            </my-question>
            <my-answer>Window functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row. They don't
                reduce the number of rows returned. OVER clause defines the window or partition. In the example, it
                calculates the average salary for each department while keeping individual row details.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>What is normalization?
                <pre>
    -- First Normal Form Example
    CREATE TABLE orders (
        order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        customer_name VARCHAR(100),
        product_list VARCHAR(255)
    );</pre>
            </my-question>
            <my-answer>Normalization is the process of organizing database schema to reduce data redundancy and improve
                data integrity. It involves breaking down large tables into smaller, more focused tables. Different
                normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) define progressive levels of database organization, minimizing duplicate
                data and potential anomalies.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>Explain the difference between UNION and JOIN.
                <pre>
    -- UNION
    SELECT name FROM employees
    UNION
    SELECT name FROM contractors;
    
    -- JOIN
    SELECT e.name, d.department_name 
    FROM employees e
    JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;</pre>
            </my-question>
            <my-answer>UNION combines result sets vertically, removing duplicates. JOIN combines tables horizontally
                based on a related column. UNION requires same number and type of columns, JOIN matches rows based on a
                common key. UNION operates on rows, JOIN operates on columns across related tables.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>What are stored procedures?
                <pre>
    CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeesByDept
    @department VARCHAR(50)
    AS
    BEGIN
        SELECT * FROM employees 
        WHERE department = @department
    END;</pre>
            </my-question>
            <my-answer>Stored procedures are precompiled SQL statements stored in the database. They can accept
                parameters, contain logic, and return results. Advantages include improved performance, enhanced
                security, and code reusability. They encapsulate complex queries and business logic within the database
                management system.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>Explain the difference between clustered and non-clustered indexes.
                <pre>
    -- Clustered Index (typically Primary Key)
    CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_Employees
    ON Employees(EmployeeID);
    
    -- Non-Clustered Index
    CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_LastName
    ON Employees(LastName);</pre>
            </my-question>
            <my-answer>Clustered indexes determine the physical order of data storage. Each table can have only one
                clustered index, typically the primary key. Non-clustered indexes are separate structures that point to
                data locations, allowing multiple non-clustered indexes per table. Clustered indexes are faster for
                range queries, while non-clustered provide additional lookup paths.</my-answer>
