    <h1>Scala interview questions</h1>

    <my-quiz>
        <my-pair>
            <my-question>What is the difference between val and var in Scala?</my-question>
            <my-answer>'val' defines an immutable value that cannot be reassigned, while 'var' creates a mutable
                variable that can be changed. Immutability is a key principle in functional programming, and Scala
                encourages using 'val' whenever possible to promote predictability and thread safety.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>Explain case classes in Scala.</my-question>
            <my-answer>Case classes automatically provide immutability, pattern matching support, companion object with
                apply/unapply methods, and sensible toString, equals, and hashCode implementations. They're typically
                used for creating lightweight data containers and are fundamental to algebraic data types in
                Scala.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>What is the difference between List and Array in Scala?</my-question>
            <my-answer>List is an immutable, linked-list implementation optimized for functional operations like
                head/tail manipulation. Array is a mutable, fixed-size data structure with constant-time random access.
                Lists are preferred in functional programming for their immutability and recursive nature.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>Explain the concept of Option in Scala.</my-question>
            <my-answer>Option is a container type that represents optional values, eliminating null pointer exceptions.
                It has two subclasses: Some(value) for present values and None for absent values. It encourages explicit
                handling of potentially missing data through pattern matching or functional combinators.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>What are traits in Scala?</my-question>
            <my-answer>Traits are similar to interfaces in Java but can contain implemented methods and fields. They
                support multiple inheritance and can be mixed into classes, enabling composition and providing a
                powerful mechanism for code reuse and modularity.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>Describe pattern matching in Scala.</my-question>
            <my-answer>Pattern matching is a powerful control structure that allows decomposing values based on their
                type or structure. It's more flexible than switch statements, supporting complex conditions, type
                checking, and extraction of values in a single expression.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>What is the difference between call-by-value and call-by-name parameters?
                <pre>
def callByValue(x: Int) = {}
def callByName(x: => Int) = {}</pre>
            </my-question>
            <my-answer>Call-by-value parameters are evaluated before method invocation, while call-by-name parameters
                are evaluated only when used inside the method. Call-by-name allows lazy evaluation and can prevent
                unnecessary computation or handle potentially undefined expressions.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>Explain higher-order functions in Scala.</my-question>
            <my-answer>Higher-order functions can take functions as parameters or return functions. They are a key
                feature of functional programming, enabling powerful abstractions like map, filter, and reduce. In
                Scala, functions are first-class citizens that can be passed around like any other value.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>What are implicit conversions and parameters?
                <pre>
implicit def intToString(x: Int): String = x.toString
def printValue(implicit format: String) = println(format)</pre>
            </my-question>
            <my-answer>Implicit conversions automatically transform one type to another, while implicit parameters are
                automatically passed if a compatible type is in scope. They enable type extensions and reduce
                boilerplate code, but should be used judiciously to maintain code readability.</my-answer>
        </my-pair>

        <my-pair>
            <my-question>Describe the Actor model in Akka (Scala's concurrency framework).</my-question>
            <my-answer>The Actor model provides a high-level abstraction for concurrent and distributed systems. Each
                actor is an independent unit that processes messages sequentially, communicating through message
                passing. This approach eliminates shared mutable state and simplifies reasoning about concurrent
                systems.</my-answer>
